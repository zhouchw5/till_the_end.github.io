# Iterating Thinking of Our Ending           
      
**Human beings are born lonely, meaning that you have no awareness of yourself or zero characteristics if you have never felt lonely. In terms of individual happiness within some specific situation, I have faith in an optimum solution.**

The robot is responsible for coming up with an optimum plan to eat apples for the poor man, to achieve the highest level of happiness, with its 综合 computing of the man's lifetime, the 空气流通 and the 光源补给 light source determining the apples' 腐烂 rate. It should be intelligent enough to simulate all the happiness 曲线 within different eating plans.Then the man can determine a 曲线 to achieve the highest level of happiness in average or to hit a peak of happiness level at some time._**.**<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$&space;\clubsuit&space;$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$&space;\clubsuit&space;$" title="$ \clubsuit $" /></a>             
          
**In general cases, we can hardly achieve the optimum solution within the sophisticated connection among people, between people and things. Connection and diversity construct the main complexity of our system, for which the development of modern technologies, revolutionizing our life, mainly focuses on enhancing mutual understanding.But in my own understanding, objectively technical development would gradually lengthen people's mental distance, in spite of the instant message getting us more closely online. This would be the unchanged tendency and technology would always tell the truth of nature. I gradually have some new arguments about happiness against existing cognitive framework. I think the essence happiness is the self iteration and replication. 我觉得要逐渐革新我们对幸福的看法。“除非你是我，才可与我常在”，要实现幸福的最大化，最终的导向是在这个世界上寻找到另外一个自己，而这个单靠人类是无法实现的。所以最后的生态肯定是人与人工智能共生。**
