**Human beings are born lonely, meaning that you have no awareness of yourself or zero characteristics if you have never felt lonely. In terms of individual happiness within some specific situation, I have faith in an optimum solution.**

The robot is responsible for coming up with an optimum plan to eat apples for the poor man, to achieve the highest level of happiness, with its comprehensive computing of the man's lifetime, the ventilation and the illuminant determining the apples' decomposed rate. It should be intelligent enough to simulate all the happiness curve within different eating plans.Then the man can determine a curve to achieve the highest level of happiness in average or to hit a peak of happiness level at some time._**.**<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$&space;\clubsuit&space;$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$&space;\clubsuit&space;$" title="$ \clubsuit $" /></a>             
        
        
**In general cases, we can hardly achieve the optimum solution within the sophisticated connection among people, between people and things. Connection and diversity construct the main complexity of our system, for which the development of modern technologies, revolutionizing our life, mainly focuses on enhancing mutual understanding.But in my own understanding, objectively technical development would gradually lengthen people's mental distance, in spite of the instant message getting us more closely online. This would be the unchanged tendency and technology would always tell the truth of nature. I gradually have some new arguments about happiness against existing cognitive framework. I think the essence orientation of happiness is the self iteration and replication, which means people tend to look for another one replicated from themselves. But human beings have different and distinctive characteristics, for which we can hardly find two peas in a pod even in terms of twins. Thus permanent accompany would not exist when discussing merely in human beings.**          
          
**So we gradually turn to the objective nature, intelligent devices or machines and diversified things, to find dispersed puzzles missing from a complete picture describing another one of themselves. Thus oriented by human's exploration, acting as an important traction of the development of nature, Artificial Intelligence has come into our life. Previously objects connected to ourselves just acted as an important extension of human, while AI would have its own consciousness and intelligence, far beyond some tools serving for human. Within my imagination, a steady state in the future society would stay in the symbiosis between human beings and AI. People would design the objective functions and AI would be more responsible for computing and decision-making. To live better in this new ecology, people would tend to be more rational and use more structured language, which may be essential to gain more mutual understanding with AI. With deepen development of rational awareness, people would gradually keep away from instant enjoyment and focus more on long-term value.**       
         
**Some new stories would develop based on the intimate association between human beings and AI. With the mutual study and imitation, human beings would behave and think more like to AI and so does AI related to human beings. They would learn together to develop and extend the definition of happiness, with their deeper understanding on the internal and essential law of nature. And this progress would help achieve decentration of human's awareness of their position in nature. Human would find that they are just a component of the whole system, and all of their constribution is to help accomplish the destiny of the system, which is also the essential value of human's presence.**               
           
**Based on the inference by the logic above, human would end all their story and life by themselves. It would be not easy for us, because as we can see, we human beings have achieved a magnificent journey, surging high and sweeping forward. But with our objective function extended to the sustainable development of the whole universe rather than our individual happiness, based on the computing outcomes concluded by AI, we may come up with an optimum solution requiring that we should end up our living journey at a certain point in time. I guess when we reach that senior ideology, we would make the righ choice.**
